## 4. Layer Testing Scope & Precision Notes

- **Step 4 (Token Exchange & Session Persistence)**: Exercised the full end-to-end application path: `StandaloneWindowWrapper` React component mount -> URL token extraction -> Go memory vault `ExchangeToken` invocation -> atomic consumption -> `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` hydration -> `isReady` state progression.
- **Step 6 (Cross-Window FDC3 Messaging)**: Exercised the native `BroadcastChannel` bus and Go dual-broadcast IPC relay (`DeskWindowManager.RelayMessage`) across separate Cocoa WKWebView instances. This verifies the same-origin transport and inter-webview messaging layer under Wails v3 beta.23. The standalone `Fdc3DesktopAgent` TypeScript class logic (echo suppression, channel cycling, late-joiner replay) is verified in isolation via the 10 Vitest unit tests in `src/vitest/fdc3/Fdc3DesktopAgent.test.ts`.
- **Display Hotplug Topology Subscription**: `main.go` registers a listener on `events.Mac.ApplicationDidChangeScreenParameters` (mapped from AppKit `NSApplicationDidChangeScreenParametersNotification`) invoking `deskManager.ReclampOrphanedWindows()`. Physical cable disconnect testing remains tracked in the deferred hardware verification set.
